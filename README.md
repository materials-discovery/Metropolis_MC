# Metropolis_MC

Here you will find a simple Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC) program in python, adapted from http://chryswoods.com/main/copyright.html. It simulates a periodic box of argon or krypton atoms. 

As for machine learning (ML) tutorials, you should follow the following steps:

1- Start by copying the Jupyter Notebook link from the GitHub folder entitled "metropolis.ipynb"

2- Open Colab in the link below: https://colab.research.google.com/

3- Select the tab Github and paste the link in the dedicated field to search for the Notebook

4- Open the link of the Notebook and press Connect

5- Each time you want to run an exercise, press on the small triangle in the black circle and wait a few seconds to see the output underneath the code.
